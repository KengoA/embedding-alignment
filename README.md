### cooccur
creates cooccurence data from enwiki and open images
```
bash ./download.sh  
bash ./run.sh
```

### glove
creates GloVe embeddings from cooccurrence data

### semi-supervised
- align embeddings with semi-supervision
- cloned from https://github.com/roads/unsupervised-alignment-team

### unsupervised
- align embeddings without supervision with Wasserstein GAN and Sinkhorn algorithm
- cloned from https://github.com/xrc10/unsup-cross-lingual-embedding-transfer
